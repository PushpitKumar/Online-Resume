<p>
  Hi, My name is Pushpit. I am a Back-end <strong>Application Developer</strong> working at Cognizant since March 2023. Primarily I have been working on projects utilizing the <strong>.NET Framework</strong> using C# and Back-end logic implemented using Stored Procedures in SQL Server. So far I have worked on creating a <strong>Batch Job</strong> which extracts latest resumes of employees and places them in a SFTP location. The resumes could be upoaded from any 3 source systems and were stored in ECM (Enterprise Content Management System) earlier. Since February 2024, this Batch Job extracts resumes from OCM (Oracle Content Management System). I have also worked on internal web application projects involving UI changes and more. I'm also working on a <strong>chatbot</strong> using <strong>Azure OpenAI</strong> to chat with your own documents. This chatbot would be able to summarize and classify information based on the available document(s) which are part of <strong>Cognitive Search Index</strong>. I was also part of a part of a 1-month remote internship program offered by <strong>Brainnest</strong>, were I worked as a <strong>Python Developer</strong>.

  My interest in the IT field goes back to my Highschool days when i first started coding in <strong>C++</strong>.  Some of the first programs I made were a <strong>Tic-Tac-Toe game</strong> and a <strong>Hotel Mangement System</strong> for my final year project. I also came across <strong>SQL</strong> and <strong>DBMS</strong> concepts that allowed me to manage data related tasks using DDL, DML and DCL statements in MySQL. In my 12<sup>th</sup> boards, I secured 90% in Computer Science which made me want to go deeper into this vast subject. My Undergraduate in Civil Engineering (2017-2021) from <strong>Manipal Institute of Technology</strong> was academically challenging and armed me with analytical skills to solve real life problems outside of the theoretical knowledge gained in lecture halls. My learning was further enhanced by interacting with peers from different programs and people from various parts of the country, which exposed me to multiple perspectives. Our college provided us with Coursera Licences free of cost, and so began my Data Science journey. In the winter break of 2019, I came across the course <i>"What is Data Science"</i> which is a part of <strong>IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</strong> on Coursera. Having had experience with SQL, I was able to complete courses which provided me with great knowledge on machine learning, python, working with data frames using pandas, linear/classification problems and so on. I decided to dig deeper into the subject and even though the online courses were a good starting point for anyone interested in the subject, they lacked the math involved behind ML algorithms and statistical concepts that are significant for data analysis. So, I started reading articles on <strong>Medium</strong> and <strong>Kaggle</strong>, along with educational videos from YouTube that aided me greatly. However, theoretical knowledge on its own isn't worth a penny, so to demonstrate my acquired understanding of the subject, I started working on ML projects which were made completely end-to-end. I started working on basic datasets on Kaggle such as the famous Titanic and House price prediction problems and then moved on to other self-learning projects like <strong>Flight Price Prediction</strong>, <strong>Rainfall Prediction in Australia</strong>, <strong>Banknote Authentication</strong>, etc. By working on these end-to-end projects, I was able to showcase my skillsets more effectively, right from data collection, analysing and visualizing the data on <strong>jupyter notebooks</strong> using <strong>python</strong> and its vast array of libraries, model building, developing the web-app using micro web-frameworks such as <strong>flask</strong> and finally deploying the app with the help of <strong>Docker</strong> on cloud platforms such as <strong>Heroku</strong>.

  Continuing my interest in data and technology after graduation, I joined the <strong>AWS re/Start</strong> program under iPrimed to kick-start my career. In these 3 months of training, I got exposed to various tools and technologies such as <strong>AWS, Linux, Networking and server management.</strong> The thing I liked most about this program was that I was able to connect with people from different backgrounds, be it experienced professionals or fresh graduates. This cohort made me appreciate working in groups in order to get the work done effectively on time. The training program was similar to an on the job training where intense class room lectures along with hands on experience through labs were conducted for 8 hours daily. I was able to work with datasets on the AWS cloud using services such as <strong>EC2</strong> instances, Amazon <strong>Athena</strong>, <strong>RDS.</strong> As part of the program, we were given vouchers to get our <strong>AWS Cloud Practitioner</strong> certification done and many companies had come for hiring. Finally, I got selected in Cognizant as a Programmer Analyst.

<p>I got into Web Developement during my internship with Cognizant, where I was trained on <strong>MVC</strong> framework, using which I developed a <strong>Todo List</strong> Web-App. This was a significant milestone as I want to make this application look more beautiful once i gain the required front-end skills which I am curretnly mastering. I plan to create my own portfolio website where I can showcase my projects and newly acquired skills. So please look forward to it!

  Coming to my personal interests, I like to game on my PS5 whenever I am free. I've been a huge sucker for games since early childhood during the Gameboy and PSP days. I love story driven games that have good characterization and world building. Action-Adventure RPGs also peek my interest, with the <strong>Souls series</strong> being one of my favorites. I don't even remember how many hours I've put into Elden Ring, but it's a lot! Apart from games, I like listening to music every now and then, both Hindi and English songs. I always go on walks and exercise well in the evening to keep myself healthy. Unfortunately, I don't have many friends living here in Gurgaon, so it can be quite boring at times. I am planning to go abroad for my higher studies which will hopefully end this boredom  being stuck at home once I meet new people. Remote work is effective and most organizations are prioritizing it these days, but it does impact your social life a lot. Anyways, I've penned down all I had to to say about myself and if you managed to make it this far, Thank You for reading!
